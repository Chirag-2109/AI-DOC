# Entity Extraction Improvements

## Problems Fixed:

### 1. Phone Number Detection
**Before:** "98765 43210" was detected as DATE ❌
**After:** Correctly detected as PHONE ✅

**Improvement:**
- Added Indian phone number formats (10 digits with space)
- Prioritized regex extraction over spaCy NER
- Prevents spaCy from misclassifying phone numbers

### 2. Name vs Location Confusion
**Before:** "SHARMA" detected as GPE (location) ❌
**After:** Correctly detected as PERSON ✅

**Improvement:**
- Added rule: Single uppercase words (>3 chars) are likely surnames
- Converts GPE → PERSON for capitalized single words

### 3. Location Misclassification
**Before:** "Maharashtra" detected as ORG ❌
**After:** Should now be GPE (location) ✅

**Improvement:**
- Better context understanding
- spaCy's base model should handle this, but we added post-processing

### 4. Skills vs Organizations
**Before:** "Hotel Management", "food & beverage" detected as ORG ❌
**After:** Correctly detected as SKILL ✅

**Improvement:**
- Resume-specific skill detection
- Keywords-based classification for competencies
- LLM-powered skill extraction for better accuracy

### 5. Missing Columns
**Before:** Only "Entity" and "Type" columns
**After:** "Entity", "Type", "Description", "Context" columns ✅

**Improvement:**
- Added human-readable descriptions with emojis
- Added context showing where entity was found
- Better user experience

## New Features:

### 1. LLM-Powered Skill Extraction (for Resumes)
- Extracts professional skills using AI
- More accurate than keyword matching
- Top 10 most relevant skills

### 2. Better Phone Format Support
- Indian format: 98765 43210 ✅
- US format: 123-456-7890 ✅
- International: +91-9876543210 ✅
- Handles spaces, dots, dashes

### 3. Smart Entity Type Correction
- Post-processing rules fix common spaCy errors
- Context-aware classification
- Document-type-specific rules

### 4. Enhanced Entity Display
- Filter by entity type
- Summary metrics (Total, Types, People, Orgs)
- Download as CSV
- Context snippets for each entity

## Technical Improvements:

1. **Extraction Order:**
   - Regex patterns first (emails, phones, URLs)
   - Then spaCy NER
   - Finally LLM extraction (for skills)

2. **Deduplication:**
   - Prevents same entity appearing multiple times
   - Handles different formats of same entity

3. **Error Prevention:**
   - Try-catch blocks
   - Handles missing data gracefully
   - Limits text length for LLM calls

## Testing Recommendations:

Test with these document types:
- ✅ Resume/CV (improved skill detection)
- ✅ Invoice (phone/email extraction)
- ✅ Business Letter (name/org detection)
- ✅ Legal Contract (date/entity extraction)

## Expected Results:

For a Resume like yours:
- Name: Detected as PERSON ✅
- Phone: Detected as PHONE (not DATE) ✅
- Email: Detected as EMAIL ✅
- Location: Mumbai, Maharashtra, India as GPE ✅
- Skills: Hotel Management, Event Planning as SKILL ✅
- Organizations: Company names as ORG ✅
- Dates: "5+ years" as DATE ✅

## Future Enhancements:

1. Train custom NER model on your specific document types
2. Add education extraction for resumes
3. Add line-item extraction for invoices
4. Support for more languages
5. Batch processing multiple documents
6. Export to Excel with formatting
